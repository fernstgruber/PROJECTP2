  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a brief overview of climate regionalization approaches. It introduces land-surface parameters relevant to assessing the short- and long-wave radiation flux of the surface. The chapter also deals with land-surface parameters, suitable to assessing the orographic effects on thermal conditions and cold air flow. The influences of the land-surface on near-ground thermodynamics, on wind velocities and the closely related precipitation distribution are discussed, emphasizing the passive effects of terrain in particular. The land-surface parameters, discussed in this chapter are either physically proved expressions or measures suitable to parameterize the multitude of orographically induced or affected atmospheric processes in the boundary layer. Land surface is one major control within the scope of atmosphere surface interactions, however, land use pattern, type and state of natural or managed vegetation cover likewise significantly affect the topo-climatic settings. Relevant surface properties, such as the meteorological roughness and vegetation/land cover, require consideration of the nature of underlying ground and its influence on the regional climate modeling applications.},

  Review                   = {land surface is a major control of the spatial differentiation of near-ground atmospheric processes and associated climatic variations. boundary layer processes in topoclimatic scales between meso (10 km) and micro (10^-3 km) are responsible for the most marked variation, such as the influence of mountains and hills on the distribution pattern of precipitation, on the flow path of cold air and particularely the differential solar radiation income of sloping surfaces woing to varying aspects, slopes and horizon screening. Climate regionalisation approaches: e.g. universal kriging, which allows the integration of controlling landsurface parameters such as elevation, slope and aspect. It provides a powerful and suitable regionalisation strategy in high terrain but require a more or less regular distribution of input data. SOLAR IRRADIATION: major causes of spatial variability of radiation on land surface; 1)orientation of earth relative to sun, 2) clouds and other atmospheric inhomogenities and 3) topography. Topographical effects on direct, diffuse and reflected radiation are not the same and must be modelled seperately. Cosine of the solar illumination angle is the hourly topographic correction for direct radiation and can be used as estimator of direct radiation received at the surface at the given moment. The sky view factor is an adjustment factor that is used to account for obstruction of overlying sky hemisphere by surrounding land surface. Despite advancements in model development, deterministic radiation models have very divers needs for necessary data input, even for clear sky conditions.. Elevation is, similar to direct solar radiation, closely correlated with the amount of diffuse solar radiation, which increases with decreasing elevations (rising levels of aerosol particles, small water droplets...) Site specific data of atmospheric properties and pyranometric measurements are not often available and usually limited in spatio temporal coverage. If additionally suitable climatological variables or appropriate satellite data are not availabe, direct estimationii of real topographic solar radiation cannot be performed. Then a calculation under potential solar radiation conditions could probably be used or, probably better, particular land-surface parameters can be applied as seterate indirect estimators, i.e. inputs to the regression analysis where the contribution of the particular land-surface parameter (e.g. daily topographic correction for direct radiation Ksd, sky view factor and terrain view factor, as independant variable) to the explanation of the examined spatial variability ( of some dependant variable) will be obtained a posteriori. TOPOGRAPHIC TEMPERATURE: in mid and high latitudes exposure-related changes in daily solar radiation income of north and south facing slope and the resulting differences in heat and mositure exchange control the spatial variation, for instance in the current soil moisture content, the phenological state, physiognomy of plants... EVEN THE DISTRIBUTION PATTERN FO SOIL TYPES REFLECTS A DIFFERENTIATION IN THE LONG TERM TRANSIENT PROCESS OF HOLOCENE SOIL FORMATION OWING TO CHANGEING RADIATION GEOMETRIES (BÖHNER 2006) wilson&gallant 2000 : land-surface temperature (index) apart from obvious north/south slope differences, there is also a significant asymmetry in the components of the diurnal energy balance of western and easter slopes (shift of bowen ratio with a higher graction of latent heat flux in the morning hourse, when the ground surface is still moist, and an increasing transfer of sensible heat in the afternoos results in a relative heat surplus on western slopes, most obviously shown in the favored south to west sloping stands of sensitive crops such as grapes. Topographic temperature is the consequence of two major processes: 1) the diurnal differential heating of sloping surfaces and 2)the nocturnal cold air formation and cold air flow: due to radiative heat loss of the ground surface and the resulting radiative transfer of sensible heat from the near surface layer to the ground. slopes; gravity causes cold, dense air to flow downwards, especially in mountainous regions. 'Depth of sink' can be used as an indirect estimator of temperature conditions in the sink, as well as estimator of air humidity, soil depth or duration of flood stagnation. This can be mapped during sink-removal (difference between corrected and original DEM). The upslope contributing area can also be seen as the cold air contributing catchment and is suggested as a suitable approach to terrain parametrisation of cold air flow. However the momenturm and dynamics of cold air currents distinctyl differ from that of much denser water, therefore an irterative slope dependent modification of the catchment area size is suggested (Cm), implemented in SAGA and originally developed as an adjusted terrain wetness index that should better represent soil moisture distribution in borad plain areas with rather homogeneous orohydrological conditions. However a more sophisticated parameterisation of the relative position of a cell within a sloping surface will further help --> altitude above channel lines. (SAGA single flow direction (different to D8) considers a terrain convergence index as a basic morphometric criterion to define overland flow paths (Böhner et al 2002). EXPLANATION OF SAGA VERTICAL CHANNEL DISTANCE EXPLAINED. This Index is suggested as a suitable landsurface parameter for climate regionalisation applications in case of SHARPLY-SHAPED ALPINE LAND SURFACE with frequent fromations of temperature inversions. In rather shallow low mountain rnages, instead, not only valleys and hollows but also elevated cold air producing expanses are comparatively cold areas, whilst mid slopes remain relatively warm throughout the night. The regionalisation of these slopes requires a landsurface parameter which integrates the vertical distances to channel lines and crest lines as well. EXPLANATION OF AN ALGO FOR ALTITUDES ABOVE DRAIN CULMINATION AND BELOW SUMMIT CULMINATION (using mean catchment altitudes and normalization....) TOPOGRAphIC PRECIPITATION In mid latitudes, frequent high reaching advection of moisture bearing air at fronts leads to increasing precipitation amounts of high mountain ranges such as the alps alongt with reduced precipitation in lower settings. The most common topographic effects on the rainfall are 1) uplift of moist air currents on the windward side of a mountain range and 2) the intimately related rain shadow effect on leeward settings induced by the blockage of moisture-bearing air. A most frequently used landsurface parameteris the DEM aspect, for instance in PRISM approach (Parameter-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) which divedes the land surface into topographic facets on eight exposures, delineated at six different spatial scales to accomodate varying orographic complexity(Daly et al 2002) Snow cover pattern can be estimated using solar radiation (thermic gradient), exposition ot the winter wind direction (terrain orientation), slope and catchment area (accumulation and decumulation of the snow), Snow potential index (Brown and Bara 1994), but always zero when towards winter wind. TOPOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO WIND: simplest parameter: relative terrain aspect (angle distance to azimuth of wind direction. second parameter;horizon angle in the wind direction Exposure to wind can be estimated using the land-surface parameters frequently used in modelling topographic solar radiation --> terrain aspect, illumination angle, horizon angle and sky view factor},

  Abstract                 = {The first soil maps were made by geologists, and many early soil maps were surficial geology maps. After soil science became established as a scientific discipline, there has been a continued interplay between geologists and soil scientists, both fields benefiting from advancements made by the other. In the 1940s and 1950s, researchers began to use soil information and soil maps to assist in the improvement or construction of various types of geologic maps. There is strong agreement between preliminary geology maps created from soil maps and traditional geology maps. This is primarily due to the influence of parent material on soil formation and may also be due in part to the importance placed on parent material in some soil classification systems. Despite the results obtained when using soil maps to create surficial geology maps, there is a need for more quantitative studies to assess the degree of compliment between soil-based maps and traditional geology maps, expansion of the technique into a wider range of geologic and climatic environments, and more research in locations that use classification systems other than US soil taxonomy.},

The examples demonstrate the wealth of soil knowledge and experience in soil management in Alpine countries.

Single-component soil polygons from conventional soil survey maps of the Langley–Vancouver Map Area, British Columbia (Canada), were used to generate randomized training points for 9 parent material classes. Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100&#xa0;m DEM. RF's mtry parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized \{RF\} resulted in a kappa index of 89.6% when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5% when validated with field data. Variable reduction and mtry optimization resulted in minimal improvements in \{RF\} predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of \{RF\} as a machine learning and data mining approach; however, the need for reliable training data was highlighted by less reliable results for polygon disaggregation in portions of the map where fewer training data points could be established.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract As soil surveys were traditionally conducted in support of agriculture, soil classification tended to focus on upper soil horizons and their characteristics. However, when dealing with environmental issues – such as vegetation ecology or water quality – an integrated knowledge of the soil, soil-to-substratum, and deeper substratum continuum is required. In both World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB) and Soil Taxonomy (ST), the lower boundary for soil classification is arbitrarily set at 2 m, including weathered and continuous rock. However, as soil classification hinges on diagnostic horizons and characteristics, which often occur within the first 100 cm, collecting data on the subsolum is often neglected. We propose a classification system of the subsolum, the structure of which is inspired by WRB. We define Regolite, Saprolite, Saprock and Bedrock as four subsolum reference groups corresponding to different weathering stages. Intergrades of these reference groups can be qualified with principal qualifiers, while morphologic and lithologic characteristics can be presented with supplementary qualifiers. The proposed subsolum classification system is not intended to substitute geological surveys, but rather to complement existing soil classification systems such that at least the whole 2 m can be categorized. Still, whenever desired the system can also be used for deeper materials. },

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide the framework for the implementation of different complex techniques for the assessment of shallow landsliding and erosion processes in mountain basins. This paper presents some morphometric indicators aimed at erosion and sediment delivery analysis. The proposed indicators can be easily derived from medium to fine resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Applications conducted in Eastern Italian Alps have shown the adequateness of the proposed approach to address erosion and sediment-related problems. The analysis considered the classification of sediment source areas with regard to their activity, the comparison between drainage basins having different morphological characteristics and the topographic control on sediment transport capacity, with a particular attention to the identification of channel reaches characterised by a low sediment transport capacity.},

Very likely short spatial range components(nuggget) don't relate to soil and can be removed.

Alternately kriging is combined with regression to model the trend function seperately s(x)=f(q,x)+e'(x) ; In regression kriging, the soil property S at unvisited site is first predicted by f(), and followed by kriging of the residuals of the model. --scorpan-simple-kriging: under assumption that e has mean=0, simple kriging allows.... versteh i ned --scorpan compositional kriging: for prediction of soil classes incorporating predictor variables Q, a form of compositional krigiing with external trend is proposed.

Both methods get rid of short-range uncorrelated noise components 4) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites : aim is to construct predictive equations for the soil attributes of interest in terms of the environmental variables. One possibility is to use Latin hypercube sampling (McKay et al., 1979), creating tuplets with characteristic combinations. At points that are similar to these tuplets soil samples schould be taken in order to consider different characteristics. Hengl has a similar metobergurgl 12.Julihod. Or sample a area that resembles the greater region. 5) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. sometimes duplicate in the range of 1/2 grid to check for shortrange variability 6) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham’s razor) - (viele viele algorithmen)- is a single model adequate/sufficient? 7) Predict digital map 8) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing - local variation and uncertainty in environmental layers will lead to error; required to provide an independent estimate of the quality of the map produced ; Marsman and de Gruijter (1986) approach is more efficient in that the sampling is designed specifically for corroboration. little work on corroboration of digital soil maps, especially of classes.

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports a close link between terrain ruggedness and forage availability for caribou during snowmelt. Indices of terrain ruggedness based on contour characteristics from topographical maps were related to field measures of cover, biomass, and live/dead ratio of graminoids within the Kuparuk Oilfield, Alaska. Terrain ruggedness was found to be the most significant factor affecting forage availability during snowmelt within the study area. Terrain ruggedness was positively correlated to 1) graminoid cover within wet, moist and dry herbaceous tundra, 2) cover of four individual graminoid species, 3) height of Salixplanifolia, 4) amount of Eriophorum vaginatum flowers, and 5) live/dead ratio of plant material during early and late snowmelt. The live/dead ratio of plant material varied among vegetation types during snowmelt, causing rugged areas to have sprouting green plant material available for forage throughout this period. While annual differences in snow depths and snowmelt will affect forage availability in a given year, indices of terrain ruggedness combined with vegetation maps can substantially improve our understanding of how forage availability for caribou may vary across the landscape during snowmelt. /// Cet article rapporte le lien étroit qui existe entre le caractère accidenté du terrain et la disponibilité d'herbage pour le caribou durant la fonte nivale. On a relié les indices d'aspérité du terrain déterminés par les caractéristiques des courbes de niveaux sur les cartes topographiques aux mesures sur le terrain du tapis, de la biomasse et du rapport de graminées vivantes aux graminées mortes dans le champ pétrolifère Kuparuk en Alaska. On a trouvé que l'aspérité du terrain était le facteur le plus important affectant la disponibilité d'herbage durant la fonte nivale dans la zone d'étude. L'aspérité du terrain était corrélée de façon positive 1) au couvert de graminées de la toundra herbacée saturée d'eau, humide et sèche, 2) au couvert de quatre espèces individuelles de graminées, 3) à la hauteur de Salix planifolia, 4) à la quantité de fleurs de Eriophorum vaginaîum et 5) au rapport du matériau végétal vivant au matériau végétal mort au début et à la fin de la fonte nivale. Le rapport de ces deux sortes de matériau végétal variait parmi les types de végétation durant la fonte nivale, ce qui faisait que les zones accidentées avaient de nouvelles pousses de matériau végétal disponibles comme herbage durant toute cette période. Bien que les différences d'une année à l'autre dans l'épaisseur de la neige et dans la fonte nivale aient des répercussions sur la disponibilité d'herbage au cours d'une année donnée, des indices de l'aspérité du terrain combinés aux cartes de végétation peuvent nous aider considérablement à comprendre comment la disponibilité d'herbage pour le caribou peut varier dans tout le territoire au cours de la fonte nivale.},

The study of morphometric land-surface parameters start with those related to the local morphometry of each point. They are divided into two main groups: (1) Geometric and (2) statistical measures. For each type of land-surface parameter, a detailed description has been given including further information on the physical phenomena described by each one. The chapter introduces some well-known parameters, such as slope or aspect, and then extends that to some less common ones, such as the Shape Complexity Index, the Anisotropic Coefficient of Variation, geostatistical land-surface parameters, or fractal-based ones that represent the most actual trend in this field.},

An effective way to introduce simple curvatures onto a slope is to consider some chosen (4) directions on it. cells with concave plan curvature(of contour line) have converging flow lines. in the same way, material flow experiences relative develeration in cells which have a concave profile curvature. Mean curvature(profc+tangc)/2, describes mean-concave and mean-convex terrains.Positive values are associated iwth areas of relative accumulation. Shary:12 curvatures, of which 3 are used to derive the rest: mean, unsphericity (how does surface differ from sphere) and difference curvature(is vertical or horizontal c stronger?). PROFC has a significant relation with soil moisture, indicating whether a cell is prone to accumulating water or not. CURVATURES ARE HOWEVER A FIRST APPROXIMATION AT A LOCAL LEVEL. visibility and line of sight, viewshed: if angle between two points A and B is smaller than that of a point closer to A, then B is not visible. viewshed is not a continuous polygon! This leads to calculation of solar irradiation. visibility index: nr of cells that can be seen from a cell. LOCAL (neighborhood): statistical parameters_ the first four moments in the distribution of a value: average, standard deviation, skewness coefficient, and the kurtosis coefficient. other examples: ruggedness=range/sqrt(area), terrain roughness=how undulating the terrain is (different concepts), for instance the stddev of heights in analysis window. to avoid incorrect results, one solution is to fit a plane to cells in the window and then calculate the stddev of the fitting instead. for densely measured elevations (LiDAR), the surface roughness index can be derived as the ratio between the fitted nugget variation and the local variance..... Anisotropy index= by variogram modelling in various directions. the Anistropy Coefficient of Variation (ACV) is the difference of the first derivative in 4 directsions, and can be used to distinguish elongated from oval landforms. Fractal dimension is an indicator of terrain complexity and closely related to terrain roughness. DISCRETE ANALYSIS: a new trend is the application of existing indices and parameters originally introduced for other types of data. Since landscape metrics mostly deal with descrete data, sliceing the DEM into elevation classes serves as discretization. Then the shape and structure of each class can be analysed to derive new indices. EXAMPLE: Shape Complexity Index SCI indicateds how compact (or oval) a feature is. REGIONAL LAND-SURFACE PARAMETERS: watershed: using flow-algorithms, go upwards and add cells connected with the outlet cell. For a given watershed, LandSurfaceParameter = sum(Ai), i=index for each cell. ; Instead of adding the mean might also be calculated. AND, to derive new meaningfull parameters, we can connect this equation with of the local land-surface parameters like slope (relates to speed and power of flow) or height (constituting the potential energy).A hypsometric curve gives information about the internal configuration of the catchment. the elevation-relief ratio can also be calacuated. (z_avg-z_min)/(z_max-z_min). Parameters based on linear measure can also be calculated for a watershed, such as flow-path lengths, or slope length (.e.g in USLE), with different methods. Teh definition of interruption cells at which the calculations stop can be done usting a fixed-slope thrshold, or a ration between slope of a cell and the one sitatued upslope, or the average or maximum uphill slope angel. With this information more parameters,like the horizontal or vertical distances to the closest channel cell can be used, for instance to relate to the wetness of the cell.

  Abstract                 = {Terrain ruggedness is often an important variable in wildlife habitat models. Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of eac...},

  Abstract                 = {The Überetsch/Oltradige region south of Bolzano (South Tyrol, Italy) is one of the most typical wine-growing areas in South Tyrol. From a geological point of view it is a very heterogeneous area due to various glacial and post-glacial deposits. In the eastern part of the area morenic deposits constitute the main geological substrate, whereas in the western part calcareous debris is the prevailing substrate for soil formation. To a lesser extent soils have developed also on lacustric sediments and fluvial gravels. These differing geological and geomorphological conditions have led to the formation of numerous different and often contrasting soil types. A detailed and systematic survey of the soils in the Überetsch/Oltradige region has been conducted in the years from 1993 to 1995 on a total area of about 2500 ha. The various soil types have been classified according to Soil Taxonomy with the description of 18 different soil series. The ‘Girlan’ series constitutes the prevailing soil type in the surveyed area. This series is located on the morenic deposits in the eastern part of the Überetsch/Oltradige and is characterised by advanced stages of pedogenesis which has led to the decalcification and acidification of the soils. The predominant textural class of the ‘Girlan’ series is sandy loam. In the depressions between the morenic hills colluvial soils of the ‘Lamm’ series are frequently interspersed. The ‘Lamm’ series is characterised by greater soil depth, less rock fragments and higher contents of organic matter and clay. The second largest soil series is the ‘St. Valentin’ series which is located on calcareous debris of the slopes along the Mendel/Mendola mountain. This series shows medium to high contents of coarse fragments, considerable amounts of calcium carbonate in the fine earth and a loamy to sandy-loamy texture. The ‘Kreuzstein’ series is located on the same substrate but differs from the previous series due to its higher contents of organic matter and clay and its lower level of calcium carbonate. Below the ‘St. Valentin’ series, on the slighter slopes at the bottom of the alluvial fans, frequently soils of the ‘Maria Rast’ series can be found. This series consists of deep soils with few coarse fragments and higher clay contents. On the fluvial gravels, which are present on the steep slopes of some valley incisions, soils of the ‘Karthein’ series prevail, typically with high contents of sand and coarse fragments and with calcium carbonate in the fine earth. On limnic sediments two soil series have been described, the ‘Paulsner Feld’ and the ‘Unterrain’ series. The soils of the ‘Paulsner Feld’ series, located on flat or slightly sloping areas, are deeply weathered, whereas the soils of the ‘Unterrain’ series, present on steep slopes, have preserved the characteristics of the un- weathered parent material due to the continuous erosive loss of topsoil.},
