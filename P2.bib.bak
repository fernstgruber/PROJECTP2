  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a brief overview of climate regionalization approaches. It introduces land-surface parameters relevant to assessing the short- and long-wave radiation flux of the surface. The chapter also deals with land-surface parameters, suitable to assessing the orographic effects on thermal conditions and cold air flow. The influences of the land-surface on near-ground thermodynamics, on wind velocities and the closely related precipitation distribution are discussed, emphasizing the passive effects of terrain in particular. The land-surface parameters, discussed in this chapter are either physically proved expressions or measures suitable to parameterize the multitude of orographically induced or affected atmospheric processes in the boundary layer. Land surface is one major control within the scope of atmosphere surface interactions, however, land use pattern, type and state of natural or managed vegetation cover likewise significantly affect the topo-climatic settings. Relevant surface properties, such as the meteorological roughness and vegetation/land cover, require consideration of the nature of underlying ground and its influence on the regional climate modeling applications.},

  Review                   = {land surface is a major control of the spatial differentiation of near-ground atmospheric processes and associated climatic variations. boundary layer processes in topoclimatic scales between meso (10 km) and micro (10^-3 km) are responsible for the most marked variation, such as the influence of mountains and hills on the distribution pattern of precipitation, on the flow path of cold air and particularely the differential solar radiation income of sloping surfaces woing to varying aspects, slopes and horizon screening. Climate regionalisation approaches: e.g. universal kriging, which allows the integration of controlling landsurface parameters such as elevation, slope and aspect. It provides a powerful and suitable regionalisation strategy in high terrain but require a more or less regular distribution of input data. SOLAR IRRADIATION: major causes of spatial variability of radiation on land surface; 1)orientation of earth relative to sun, 2) clouds and other atmospheric inhomogenities and 3) topography. Topographical effects on direct, diffuse and reflected radiation are not the same and must be modelled seperately. Cosine of the solar illumination angle is the hourly topographic correction for direct radiation and can be used as estimator of direct radiation received at the surface at the given moment. The sky view factor is an adjustment factor that is used to account for obstruction of overlying sky hemisphere by surrounding land surface. Despite advancements in model development, deterministic radiation models have very divers needs for necessary data input, even for clear sky conditions.. Elevation is, similar to direct solar radiation, closely correlated with the amount of diffuse solar radiation, which increases with decreasing elevations (rising levels of aerosol particles, small water droplets...) Site specific data of atmospheric properties and pyranometric measurements are not often available and usually limited in spatio temporal coverage. If additionally suitable climatological variables or appropriate satellite data are not availabe, direct estimationii of real topographic solar radiation cannot be performed. Then a calculation under potential solar radiation conditions could probably be used or, probably better, particular land-surface parameters can be applied as seterate indirect estimators, i.e. inputs to the regression analysis where the contribution of the particular land-surface parameter (e.g. daily topographic correction for direct radiation Ksd, sky view factor and terrain view factor, as independant variable) to the explanation of the examined spatial variability ( of some dependant variable) will be obtained a posteriori. TOPOGRAPHIC TEMPERATURE: in mid and high latitudes exposure-related changes in daily solar radiation income of north and south facing slope and the resulting differences in heat and mositure exchange control the spatial variation, for instance in the current soil moisture content, the phenological state, physiognomy of plants... EVEN THE DISTRIBUTION PATTERN FO SOIL TYPES REFLECTS A DIFFERENTIATION IN THE LONG TERM TRANSIENT PROCESS OF HOLOCENE SOIL FORMATION OWING TO CHANGEING RADIATION GEOMETRIES (BÖHNER 2006) wilson&gallant 2000 : land-surface temperature (index) apart from obvious north/south slope differences, there is also a significant asymmetry in the components of the diurnal energy balance of western and easter slopes (shift of bowen ratio with a higher graction of latent heat flux in the morning hourse, when the ground surface is still moist, and an increasing transfer of sensible heat in the afternoos results in a relative heat surplus on western slopes, most obviously shown in the favored south to west sloping stands of sensitive crops such as grapes. Topographic temperature is the consequence of two major processes: 1) the diurnal differential heating of sloping surfaces and 2)the nocturnal cold air formation and cold air flow: due to radiative heat loss of the ground surface and the resulting radiative transfer of sensible heat from the near surface layer to the ground. slopes; gravity causes cold, dense air to flow downwards, especially in mountainous regions. 'Depth of sink' can be used as an indirect estimator of temperature conditions in the sink, as well as estimator of air humidity, soil depth or duration of flood stagnation. This can be mapped during sink-removal (difference between corrected and original DEM). The upslope contributing area can also be seen as the cold air contributing catchment and is suggested as a suitable approach to terrain parametrisation of cold air flow. However the momenturm and dynamics of cold air currents distinctyl differ from that of much denser water, therefore an irterative slope dependent modification of the catchment area size is suggested (Cm), implemented in SAGA and originally developed as an adjusted terrain wetness index that should better represent soil moisture distribution in borad plain areas with rather homogeneous orohydrological conditions. However a more sophisticated parameterisation of the relative position of a cell within a sloping surface will further help --> altitude above channel lines. (SAGA single flow direction (different to D8) considers a terrain convergence index as a basic morphometric criterion to define overland flow paths (Böhner et al 2002). EXPLANATION OF SAGA VERTICAL CHANNEL DISTANCE EXPLAINED. This Index is suggested as a suitable landsurface parameter for climate regionalisation applications in case of SHARPLY-SHAPED ALPINE LAND SURFACE with frequent fromations of temperature inversions. In rather shallow low mountain rnages, instead, not only valleys and hollows but also elevated cold air producing expanses are comparatively cold areas, whilst mid slopes remain relatively warm throughout the night. The regionalisation of these slopes requires a landsurface parameter which integrates the vertical distances to channel lines and crest lines as well. EXPLANATION OF AN ALGO FOR ALTITUDES ABOVE DRAIN CULMINATION AND BELOW SUMMIT CULMINATION (using mean catchment altitudes and normalization....) TOPOGRAphIC PRECIPITATION In mid latitudes, frequent high reaching advection of moisture bearing air at fronts leads to increasing precipitation amounts of high mountain ranges such as the alps alongt with reduced precipitation in lower settings. The most common topographic effects on the rainfall are 1) uplift of moist air currents on the windward side of a mountain range and 2) the intimately related rain shadow effect on leeward settings induced by the blockage of moisture-bearing air. A most frequently used landsurface parameteris the DEM aspect, for instance in PRISM approach (Parameter-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) which divedes the land surface into topographic facets on eight exposures, delineated at six different spatial scales to accomodate varying orographic complexity(Daly et al 2002) Snow cover pattern can be estimated using solar radiation (thermic gradient), exposition ot the winter wind direction (terrain orientation), slope and catchment area (accumulation and decumulation of the snow), Snow potential index (Brown and Bara 1994), but always zero when towards winter wind. TOPOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO WIND: simplest parameter: relative terrain aspect (angle distance to azimuth of wind direction. second parameter;horizon angle in the wind direction Exposure to wind can be estimated using the land-surface parameters frequently used in modelling topographic solar radiation --> terrain aspect, illumination angle, horizon angle and sky view factor},

  Abstract                 = {The first soil maps were made by geologists, and many early soil maps were surficial geology maps. After soil science became established as a scientific discipline, there has been a continued interplay between geologists and soil scientists, both fields benefiting from advancements made by the other. In the 1940s and 1950s, researchers began to use soil information and soil maps to assist in the improvement or construction of various types of geologic maps. There is strong agreement between preliminary geology maps created from soil maps and traditional geology maps. This is primarily due to the influence of parent material on soil formation and may also be due in part to the importance placed on parent material in some soil classification systems. Despite the results obtained when using soil maps to create surficial geology maps, there is a need for more quantitative studies to assess the degree of compliment between soil-based maps and traditional geology maps, expansion of the technique into a wider range of geologic and climatic environments, and more research in locations that use classification systems other than US soil taxonomy.},

Based on case studies from different landscapes in the Alps the chapter illustrates soil–society relations regarding both the land-use impact on soils as well as soil data needs for land-use management. In terms of soil survey in the Alps, we present and discuss innovative approaches to soil mapping, geographic information systems (GIS) embedding, and modeling in order to better integrate soil data in land-use planning and management. The examples demonstrate the wealth of soil knowledge and experience in soil management in Alpine countries. Nevertheless the chapter emphasizes that further research, cross-border knowledge, and soil protection best practice transfer as well as the improvement of soil-data collection and use are needed to strengthen daily sustainable soil management in the Alps. },

  Abstract                 = {Landform delineation has long been used in digital soil mapping to infer soil-relevant information. While its potential as an environmental variable in soil parameter modeling has been investigated for various automated landform delineations, little research has been invested into the relationship between the delineation of landforms by algorithms based on digital terrain models (DTM) and the perception of landforms by the soil surveyor during field work. Five Open Source automated landform classification algorithms and a support vector machine classifier based on single terrain parameters are investigated with regard to their ability to replicate topographic position, at two different scales, as described by surveyors for soil profile sites in the Alpine environment of South Tyrol. We also analyse how the variation of parameters and cell size affects the distribution of the computed landforms. While a clear trend regarding grid cell size and window size can be observed with regard to the difference between macro and meso scale topographic positions, the overall classification accuracy regarding the different topographic position classes was less promising. Although some automated classifications partly resemble the surveyor's classification, a considerable number of issues remain to be investigated in order to explain the lack of reproducibility of surveyor position, some of which are linked to the Alpine environment of the study area. These include the dominance of the backslope position, the objectivity of the surveyor in rugged terrain under forest cover, and the fuzzy nature of classifying topographic position, especially in steep terrain. By applying a forward stepwise feature selection procedure for a model based on single terrain parameters, we show that at macro scale a regional terrain parameter (topographic wetness index) and curvatures at a coarse DTM resolution of 50m are the most influential in distinguishing topographic position, whereas at meso scale it is the topographic position index (TPI) with a search radius of just 70m combined with slope gradient. This study is an important first step towards consolidating topographic perception during field survey and digital terrain analysis, which, at least in Alpine terrain, still requires more investigation.},

Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100&#xa0;m DEM. RF's mtry parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized \{RF\} resulted in a kappa index of 89.6% when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5% when validated with field data. Variable reduction and mtry optimization resulted in minimal improvements in \{RF\} predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of \{RF\} as a machine learning and data mining approach; however, the need for reliable training data was highlighted by less reliable results for polygon disaggregation in portions of the map where fewer training data points could be established.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Machine-learning is the automated process of uncovering patterns in large datasets using computer-based statistical models, where a fitted model may then be used for prediction purposes on new data. Despite the growing number of machine-learning algorithms that have been developed, relatively few studies have provided a comparison of an array of different learners — typically, model comparison studies have been restricted to a comparison of only a few models. This study evaluates and compares a suite of 10 machine-learners as classification algorithms for the prediction of soil taxonomic units in the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada. A variety of machine-learners (CART, CART with bagging, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbor, nearest shrunken centroid, artificial neural network, multinomial logistic regression, logistic model trees, and support vector machine) were tested in the extraction of the complex relationships between soil taxonomic units (great groups and orders) from a conventional soil survey and a suite of 20 environmental covariates representing the topography, climate, and vegetation of the study area. Methods used to extract training data from a soil survey included by-polygon, equal-class, area-weighted, and area-weighted with random over sampling (ROS) approaches. The fitted models, which consist of the soil-environmental relationships, were then used to predict soil great groups and orders for the entire study area at a 100m spatial resolution. The resulting maps were validated using 262 points from legacy soil data. On average, the area-weighted sampling approach for developing training data from a soil survey was most effective. Using a validation of R=1 cell, the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine with radial basis function resulted in the highest accuracy of 72% for great groups using ROS; however, models such as CART with bagging, logistic model trees, and Random Forest were preferred due to the speed of parameterization and the interpretability of the results while resulting in similar accuracies ranging from 65–70% using the area-weighted sampling approach. Model choice and sample design greatly influenced outputs. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of machine-learning techniques for classification purposes in soil science and may assist in model selection for digital soil mapping and geomorphic modeling studies in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {An iterative procedure that implements the classification of continuous topography as a problem in digital image-processing automatically divides an area into categories of surface form; three taxonomic criteria–slope gradient, local convexity, and surface texture–are calculated from a square-grid digital elevation model (DEM). The sequence of programmed operations combines twofold-partitioned maps of the three variables converted to greyscale images, using the mean of each variable as the dividing threshold. To subdivide increasingly subtle topography, grid cells sloping at less than mean gradient of the input DEM are classified by designating mean values of successively lower-sloping subsets of the study area (nested means) as taxonomic thresholds, thereby increasing the number of output categories from the minimum 8 to 12 or 16. Program output is exemplified by 16 topographic types for the world at 1-km spatial resolution (SRTM30 data), the Japanese Islands at 270 m, and part of Hokkaido at 55 m. Because the procedure is unsupervised and reflects frequency distributions of the input variables rather than pre-set criteria, the resulting classes are undefined and must be calibrated empirically by subsequent analysis. Maps of the example classifications reflect physiographic regions, geological structure, and landform as well as slope materials and processes; fine-textured terrain categories tend to correlate with erosional topography or older surfaces, coarse-textured classes with areas of little dissection. In Japan the resulting classes approximate landform types mapped from airphoto analysis, while in the Americas they create map patterns resembling Hammond's terrain types or surface-form classes; SRTM30 output for the United States compares favorably with Fenneman's physical divisions. Experiments are suggested for further developing the method; the Arc/Info AML and the map of terrain classes for the world are available as online downloads.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a {DEM} based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a {DEM} assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30&#xa0;m cell−&#xa0;1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

  Review                   = {IMPLEMENTED IN GRASS 7 Allgemein: most existing methods of automated landform classification have their roots in differential geometry. The differences between different existing approaches focus on how to best utilize the information contained in geomorphometric variables, and on the choice of target units of classification. Methods can be divided into those which are cell-based and those which are oject based. They can be also divided into those which use a classifier designed manually on the basis of expert knowledge and empirical evidence and those which use a classifier generated by a machine learning algorithm Finally, methods can be divided with respect to target units of classification (Minar and Evans, 2008); considered units include: landforms, landform elements, and physio graphic units (für zitate siehe paper). NOVEL APPORACH THAT DEPARTS FROM EXISTING METHODOLOGIES: we classify landform elements using tools of computer vision rather than tools of differential geometry. Thus, our algorithm attempts to mimic the classification process carried out by a human analyst. Image texture refers to the spatial arrangement of grayscale intensities in a selected region of an image. we utilize the concept of Local Ternary Patterns (LTP) (Liao, 2010) to identify local landform elements. The set of all possible LTPs is finite (498). Geomorphons are fundamental micro-structures of landscape. Instead of using a fixed-size neighborhood to collect elevation values for determination of LTP, we use a neighborhood with size and shape that self-adapts to the local topography. This self-adaptation technique utilizes the line-of-sight principle (Lee, 1991; Nagy, 1994; Yokoyama et al., 2002) and ensures that landforms are identified at their most appropriate spatial scale. We demonstrate how to generate a map of the 10 most common landform elements (peak, ridge, shoulder, spur, slope, hollow, footslope, valley, pit, and flat) using geomorphons. local ternary patterns: looks at 8 neighbours, gives them the values lower,same,equal. In practive however the quantity derived from line-of-sight-principle is used instead of simply the elevation values. By using different L-values (lookup-distance) landform elements can be identified on a wider range of scales than with the grid-based neighbourhood. CLASSIFICATION INTO 10 LANDFORMS: While traversing a LTP in order of principal directions a “transition” is a change in ternary element. Thus geomorphons flat, peak, and pit have 0 transitions, as all ternary elements in their patterns are the same. Shoulder, spur, hollow, and valley have 2 transitions, while ridge, valley, and slope have 4 transitions. We have chosen a reclassification formula based on a particular lookup table constructed on the basis of similarity between ternary patterns representing the geomorphons; patterns are similar if they have similar number of different ternary elements. GOOD DESCRIPTION OF HOW THEY COMPARED THEIR APPROACH TO THOSE OF WOOD and DIKAU with GRASS: other methods are incomplete.., it is possible to merge (Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004) Wood's and Dikau's classification schemes into a single scheme showing all 15 landform types, but needs fuzzy classification (computational cost!) SCALE FLEXIBILITY: The geomorphons method does not use a fixed-size neighborhood, instead the size and the shape of a neighborhood from which the land- form element is determined adjusts automatically to the geometry of the local terrain. The value of L determines the maximum scale at which we can find the landform element; it needs to be set to a relatively large value in order for the map to show landform elements at a broad range of scales. The inner, irregular octagons are determined by the LOS-principle in the 8 principle directions. Increasing L values converge to same result. CONCLUSION: Geomorphons represent a paradigm shift in DEM classification. First, the method is underpinned by principles of machine vision rather than differential geometry. Second, it classifies landforms at different spatial scales simultaneously.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract As soil surveys were traditionally conducted in support of agriculture, soil classification tended to focus on upper soil horizons and their characteristics. However, when dealing with environmental issues – such as vegetation ecology or water quality – an integrated knowledge of the soil, soil-to-substratum, and deeper substratum continuum is required. In both World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB) and Soil Taxonomy (ST), the lower boundary for soil classification is arbitrarily set at 2 m, including weathered and continuous rock. However, as soil classification hinges on diagnostic horizons and characteristics, which often occur within the first 100 cm, collecting data on the subsolum is often neglected. We propose a classification system of the subsolum, the structure of which is inspired by WRB. We define Regolite, Saprolite, Saprock and Bedrock as four subsolum reference groups corresponding to different weathering stages. Intergrades of these reference groups can be qualified with principal qualifiers, while morphologic and lithologic characteristics can be presented with supplementary qualifiers. The proposed subsolum classification system is not intended to substitute geological surveys, but rather to complement existing soil classification systems such that at least the whole 2 m can be categorized. Still, whenever desired the system can also be used for deeper materials. },

The proposed indicators can be easily derived from medium to fine resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Applications conducted in Eastern Italian Alps have shown the adequateness of the proposed approach to address erosion and sediment-related problems. The analysis considered the classification of sediment source areas with regard to their activity, the comparison between drainage basins having different morphological characteristics and the topographic control on sediment transport capacity, with a particular attention to the identification of channel reaches characterised by a low sediment transport capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {A map of extant slope failures is the most basic element of any landslide assessment. Without an accurate inventory of slope instability, it is not possible to analyze the controls on the spatial and temporal patterns of mass movement or the environmental, human, or geomorphic consequences of slides. Landslide inventory maps are tedious to compile, difficult to make in vegetated terrain using conventional techniques, and tend to be subjective. In addition, most landslide inventories simply outline landslide boundaries and do not offer information about landslide mechanics as manifested by internal deformation features. In an alternative approach, we constructed accurate, high-resolution DEMs from airborne laser altimetry (LIDAR) data to characterize a large landslide complex and surrounding terrain near Christchurch, New Zealand. One-dimensional, circular (2-D) and spherical (3-D) statistics are used to map the local topographic roughness in the DEMs over a spatial scale of 1.5 to 10 m. The bedrock landslide is rougher than adjacent unfailed terrain and any of the statistics can be employed to automatically detect and map the overall slide complex. Furthermore, statistics that include a measure of the local variability of aspect successfully delineate four kinematic units within the gently sloping lower half of the slide. Features with a minimum size of surface folds that have a wavelength of about 11 to 12 m and amplitude of about 1 m are readily mapped. Two adjacent earthflows within the landslide complex are distinguished by a contrast in median roughness, and texture and continuity of roughness elements. The less active of the earthflows has a surface morphology that presumably has been smoothed by surface processes. The Laplacian operator also accurately maps the kinematic units and the folds and longitudinal levees within and at the margins of the units. Finally, two-dimensional power spectra analyses are used to quantify how roughness varies with length scale. These results indicate that no dominant length scale of roughness exists for smooth, unfailed terrain. In contrast, zones with different styles of landslide deformation exhibit distinctive spectral peaks that correspond to the scale of deformation features, such as the compression folds. The topographic-based analyses described here may be used to objectively delineate landslide features, generate mechanical inferences about landslide behavior, and evaluate relatively the recent activity of slides.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports a close link between terrain ruggedness and forage availability for caribou during snowmelt. Indices of terrain ruggedness based on contour characteristics from topographical maps were related to field measures of cover, biomass, and live/dead ratio of graminoids within the Kuparuk Oilfield, Alaska. Terrain ruggedness was found to be the most significant factor affecting forage availability during snowmelt within the study area. Terrain ruggedness was positively correlated to 1) graminoid cover within wet, moist and dry herbaceous tundra, 2) cover of four individual graminoid species, 3) height of Salixplanifolia, 4) amount of Eriophorum vaginatum flowers, and 5) live/dead ratio of plant material during early and late snowmelt. The live/dead ratio of plant material varied among vegetation types during snowmelt, causing rugged areas to have sprouting green plant material available for forage throughout this period. While annual differences in snow depths and snowmelt will affect forage availability in a given year, indices of terrain ruggedness combined with vegetation maps can substantially improve our understanding of how forage availability for caribou may vary across the landscape during snowmelt. /// Cet article rapporte le lien étroit qui existe entre le caractère accidenté du terrain et la disponibilité d'herbage pour le caribou durant la fonte nivale. On a relié les indices d'aspérité du terrain déterminés par les caractéristiques des courbes de niveaux sur les cartes topographiques aux mesures sur le terrain du tapis, de la biomasse et du rapport de graminées vivantes aux graminées mortes dans le champ pétrolifère Kuparuk en Alaska. On a trouvé que l'aspérité du terrain était le facteur le plus important affectant la disponibilité d'herbage durant la fonte nivale dans la zone d'étude. L'aspérité du terrain était corrélée de façon positive 1) au couvert de graminées de la toundra herbacée saturée d'eau, humide et sèche, 2) au couvert de quatre espèces individuelles de graminées, 3) à la hauteur de Salix planifolia, 4) à la quantité de fleurs de Eriophorum vaginaîum et 5) au rapport du matériau végétal vivant au matériau végétal mort au début et à la fin de la fonte nivale. Le rapport de ces deux sortes de matériau végétal variait parmi les types de végétation durant la fonte nivale, ce qui faisait que les zones accidentées avaient de nouvelles pousses de matériau végétal disponibles comme herbage durant toute cette période. Bien que les différences d'une année à l'autre dans l'épaisseur de la neige et dans la fonte nivale aient des répercussions sur la disponibilité d'herbage au cours d'une année donnée, des indices de l'aspérité du terrain combinés aux cartes de végétation peuvent nous aider considérablement à comprendre comment la disponibilité d'herbage pour le caribou peut varier dans tout le territoire au cours de la fonte nivale.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents different formulations, each one of them with a different degree of mathematical complexity, to extract basic morphometric parameters from the digital elevation model (DEM) itself and then discuss importance and interpretation of each parameter. The study of morphometric land-surface parameters start with those related to the local morphometry of each point. They are divided into two main groups: (1) Geometric and (2) statistical measures. For each type of land-surface parameter, a detailed description has been given including further information on the physical phenomena described by each one. The chapter introduces some well-known parameters, such as slope or aspect, and then extends that to some less common ones, such as the Shape Complexity Index, the Anisotropic Coefficient of Variation, geostatistical land-surface parameters, or fractal-based ones that represent the most actual trend in this field.},

  Review                   = {basic parameters: derived directly from DEM, represent the raw shape of the land surface regardless of relationship to formational processes. LOCAL: geometric parameters: methods based on formal mathematical approach have proven give better results. #functions of first derivative# slope: description of evans method. area of a cell: also different methods (eg considering the surrounding cell heights) aspect: is a circular land-surface parameter, therefore some others use cos(a) as slope northness and sin(a) as slope easterness, especially in statistical comparisons. shaded relief: the simplest approach neglects surrounding relief and considers insolation as a local parameter hydrology is an important field applying geomorphometry, which hast resulted in specific formulations for calculating slope and aspect,starting with D8(using the maximum-slope, which usually overestimates slope, and aspect values can only be a multiple of 45°, restricting their range and discretizing the slope measurement).D-infinity also consider the two adjacent directions to account for discretization. #functions of second derivatives#: an important concept for understanding curvature is the 'normal section of a smoothed surface'.A normal section is a plane curve, the curvature of which is defined as 1/R, where R is the radius of the best-fitting circle. An effective way to introduce simple curvatures onto a slope is to consider some chosen (4) directions on it. cells with concave plan curvature(of contour line) have converging flow lines. in the same way, material flow experiences relative develeration in cells which have a concave profile curvature. Mean curvature(profc+tangc)/2, describes mean-concave and mean-convex terrains.Positive values are associated iwth areas of relative accumulation. Shary:12 curvatures, of which 3 are used to derive the rest: mean, unsphericity (how does surface differ from sphere) and difference curvature(is vertical or horizontal c stronger?). PROFC has a significant relation with soil moisture, indicating whether a cell is prone to accumulating water or not. CURVATURES ARE HOWEVER A FIRST APPROXIMATION AT A LOCAL LEVEL. visibility and line of sight, viewshed: if angle between two points A and B is smaller than that of a point closer to A, then B is not visible. viewshed is not a continuous polygon! This leads to calculation of solar irradiation. visibility index: nr of cells that can be seen from a cell. LOCAL (neighborhood): statistical parameters_ the first four moments in the distribution of a value: average, standard deviation, skewness coefficient, and the kurtosis coefficient. other examples: ruggedness=range/sqrt(area), terrain roughness=how undulating the terrain is (different concepts), for instance the stddev of heights in analysis window. to avoid incorrect results, one solution is to fit a plane to cells in the window and then calculate the stddev of the fitting instead. for densely measured elevations (LiDAR), the surface roughness index can be derived as the ratio between the fitted nugget variation and the local variance..... Anisotropy index= by variogram modelling in various directions. the Anistropy Coefficient of Variation (ACV) is the difference of the first derivative in 4 directsions, and can be used to distinguish elongated from oval landforms. Fractal dimension is an indicator of terrain complexity and closely related to terrain roughness. DISCRETE ANALYSIS: a new trend is the application of existing indices and parameters originally introduced for other types of data. Since landscape metrics mostly deal with descrete data, sliceing the DEM into elevation classes serves as discretization. Then the shape and structure of each class can be analysed to derive new indices. EXAMPLE: Shape Complexity Index SCI indicateds how compact (or oval) a feature is. REGIONAL LAND-SURFACE PARAMETERS: watershed: using flow-algorithms, go upwards and add cells connected with the outlet cell. For a given watershed, LandSurfaceParameter = sum(Ai), i=index for each cell. ; Instead of adding the mean might also be calculated. AND, to derive new meaningfull parameters, we can connect this equation with of the local land-surface parameters like slope (relates to speed and power of flow) or height (constituting the potential energy).A hypsometric curve gives information about the internal configuration of the catchment. the elevation-relief ratio can also be calacuated. (z_avg-z_min)/(z_max-z_min). Parameters based on linear measure can also be calculated for a watershed, such as flow-path lengths, or slope length (.e.g in USLE), with different methods. Teh definition of interruption cells at which the calculations stop can be done usting a fixed-slope thrshold, or a ration between slope of a cell and the one sitatued upslope, or the average or maximum uphill slope angel. With this information more parameters,like the horizontal or vertical distances to the closest channel cell can be used, for instance to relate to the wetness of the cell.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The area of land use or land cover change obtained directly from a map may differ greatly from the true area of change because of map classification error. An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user's, producer's and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Layering is common in soils, due to a variety of pedologic and geologic processes, and has important consequences for the interpretation of soils and landscapes. Layering can derive from original sedimentary layering; depositional upbuilding; episodic surface erosion, deposition, and stability; soil production by weathering; vertical or lateral translocation; bioturbation; and various combinations of these. Complex and polygenetic models incorporate both geogenic and pedogenic processes, and allow for physical and biological processes, as well as both vertical and horizontal movements. We review these conceptual frameworks and synthesize them into a vertical contrast model (VCM) for interpreting layered surficial materials. The VCM incorporates a variety of geologic and pedologic processes which may create, destroy, enhance, or obscure vertical contrasts. The model is illustrated via application to sites in the Ouachita Mountains, USA, and northwest Saxonian Lowlands, Germany. The examples illustrate the importance of a comprehensive pedogeomorphic interpretation of layering, since neither standard stratigraphic or top–down pedogenetic principles necessarily apply. The examples also show that the same process can, sometimes contemporaneously, both create and destroy vertical contrasts.},

Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of eac...},

  Abstract                 = {The Überetsch/Oltradige region south of Bolzano (South Tyrol, Italy) is one of the most typical wine-growing areas in South Tyrol. From a geological point of view it is a very heterogeneous area due to various glacial and post-glacial deposits. In the eastern part of the area morenic deposits constitute the main geological substrate, whereas in the western part calcareous debris is the prevailing substrate for soil formation. To a lesser extent soils have developed also on lacustric sediments and fluvial gravels. These differing geological and geomorphological conditions have led to the formation of numerous different and often contrasting soil types. A detailed and systematic survey of the soils in the Überetsch/Oltradige region has been conducted in the years from 1993 to 1995 on a total area of about 2500 ha. The various soil types have been classified according to Soil Taxonomy with the description of 18 different soil series. The ‘Girlan’ series constitutes the prevailing soil type in the surveyed area. This series is located on the morenic deposits in the eastern part of the Überetsch/Oltradige and is characterised by advanced stages of pedogenesis which has led to the decalcification and acidification of the soils. The predominant textural class of the ‘Girlan’ series is sandy loam. In the depressions between the morenic hills colluvial soils of the ‘Lamm’ series are frequently interspersed. The ‘Lamm’ series is characterised by greater soil depth, less rock fragments and higher contents of organic matter and clay. The second largest soil series is the ‘St. Valentin’ series which is located on calcareous debris of the slopes along the Mendel/Mendola mountain. This series shows medium to high contents of coarse fragments, considerable amounts of calcium carbonate in the fine earth and a loamy to sandy-loamy texture. The ‘Kreuzstein’ series is located on the same substrate but differs from the previous series due to its higher contents of organic matter and clay and its lower level of calcium carbonate. Below the ‘St. Valentin’ series, on the slighter slopes at the bottom of the alluvial fans, frequently soils of the ‘Maria Rast’ series can be found. This series consists of deep soils with few coarse fragments and higher clay contents. On the fluvial gravels, which are present on the steep slopes of some valley incisions, soils of the ‘Karthein’ series prevail, typically with high contents of sand and coarse fragments and with calcium carbonate in the fine earth. On limnic sediments two soil series have been described, the ‘Paulsner Feld’ and the ‘Unterrain’ series. The soils of the ‘Paulsner Feld’ series, located on flat or slightly sloping areas, are deeply weathered, whereas the soils of the ‘Unterrain’ series, present on steep slopes, have preserved the characteristics of the un- weathered parent material due to the continuous erosive loss of topsoil.},
